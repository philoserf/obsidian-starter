# obsidian-starter

Opinion: Do not start with other people's clutter and cruft!

After a year of using Obsidian, I am finally ready to share my recommended starter vault configuration.

https://github.com/philoserf/obsidian-starter/releases/tag/v1.0

This is a clean, uncluttered, minimalist setup for beginner or advanced Obsidian users. While it is minimalist it is also opinionated. Take a look for yourself and see how you might adapt it to your needs.

At least one test user was able to use this GitHub template with the Visual Studio Code Foam plugin too.

Good luck and happy note-taking and note-making.

Warning: There are two crufty bits in this starter vault as a result of GitHub best practices. Feel free to remove the README.md and LICENSE files after you fork the repository with the “Use this template” button.
